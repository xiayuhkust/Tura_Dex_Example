# Tura DEX Implementation Details

## Core Components

### Factory Contract
The Factory contract manages pool creation and fee tier configuration:
- Pool deployment with deterministic addresses
- Fee tier management (0.05%, 0.3%, 1%)
- Tick spacing configuration per fee tier

### Pool Contract
The Pool contract implements core DEX functionality:
```solidity
contract UniswapV3Pool is IUniswapV3Pool, ReentrancyGuard {
    // Core state variables
    address public immutable factory;
    address public immutable token0;
    address public immutable token1;
    uint24 public immutable fee;
    int24 public immutable tickSpacing;
    
    // Price and liquidity tracking
    Slot0 private _slot0;
    mapping(bytes32 => IPosition.Info) public positions;
    mapping(int24 => Tick.Info) public ticks;
    uint128 public liquidity;
}
```

### Key Features
1. Concentrated Liquidity
   - Position-based liquidity tracking
   - Tick-based price ranges
   - Dynamic fee growth tracking

2. Swap Mechanism
   - Zero for one and one for zero swaps
   - Fee calculation and collection
   - Price impact protection
   - Slippage checks

3. Position Management
   - Liquidity addition/removal
   - Fee collection
   - Range-based positions

## Libraries
- TickMath: Price-tick conversions
- SqrtPriceMath: Price calculations
- Position: Position management
- FullMath: Fixed-point arithmetic

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Pool initialization
- Liquidity provision
- Swap execution
- Fee collection

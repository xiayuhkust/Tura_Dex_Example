# Tura DEX Deployment Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step deployment strategy for the Tura DEX, based on Uniswap V3 architecture.

## Environment Setup
- Solidity Version: 0.7.6
- Network: Tura Blockchain
  - RPC: https://rpc-beta1.turablockchain.com
  - Chain ID: 1337
  - Test Account: [ad6fb1ceb0b9dc598641ac1cef545a7882b52f5a12d7204d6074762d96a8a474]

## Deployment Sequence

### Phase 1: Core Contracts
1. Factory Contract (UniswapV3Factory)
   - Handles pool creation and management
   - No dependencies
   - Testing: Verify pool creation functionality

### Phase 2: Periphery - Basic Swap Infrastructure
2. Router Contract (SwapRouter)
   - Dependencies: Factory Contract
   - Uses Tura as native token (equivalent to ETH in reference implementation)
   - Testing: Verify routing and basic swap functionality

### Phase 3: NFT Infrastructure
3. NFT Position Descriptor Contract
   - Dependencies: None
   - Configure for Tura token naming
   - Testing: Verify position description generation

4. NFT Position Manager Contract
   - Dependencies: Factory, Position Descriptor
   - Testing: Verify position management and NFT minting

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests for each contract
2. Integration Tests between contracts
3. End-to-end Tests for complete workflows
4. Special focus on Tura native token integration

## Deployment Scripts
1. deploy_1_factory.ts
2. deploy_2_router.ts
3. deploy_3_position_descriptor.ts
4. deploy_4_position_manager.ts

Each script will:
- Deploy the contract
- Verify deployment
- Save contract address
- Run basic verification tests

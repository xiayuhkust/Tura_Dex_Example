# Deployment Architecture and Requirements

## Smart Contract Deployment Flow

1. Core Contracts
   - Deploy Factory contract first
   - Factory handles pool deployment
   - Set initial protocol fees

2. Peripheral Contracts
   - Deploy SwapRouter
   - Deploy NFT position manager
   - Deploy periphery libraries

3. Frontend Integration
   - Web3 provider setup
   - Contract interaction layer
   - User interface components

## Infrastructure Requirements

1. Blockchain Requirements
   - EVM compatibility
   - Support for Solidity ^0.7.6
   - Gas optimization considerations

2. Development Environment
   - Hardhat framework
   - OpenZeppelin contracts
   - Testing infrastructure

3. Frontend Requirements
   - Web3 libraries
   - React framework
   - State management

## Integration Points

1. Smart Contract Integration
   - Factory contract address
   - Router contract address
   - Token standards (ERC20)

2. Frontend Integration
   - Web3 provider
   - Contract ABIs
   - User wallet connection

3. Price Oracle Integration
   - TWAP calculations
   - Price feed mechanisms
   - Oracle updates

## Security Considerations

1. Smart Contract Security
   - Access control
   - Reentrancy protection
   - Integer overflow protection

2. Frontend Security
   - Transaction signing
   - Input validation
   - Error handling

3. Protocol Security
   - Fee mechanisms
   - Flash loan protection
   - Price manipulation prevention

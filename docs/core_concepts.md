- Controls protocol fees
- Manages pool creation with different fee tiers
- Maintains registry of all created pools

### Pool Contract
- Implements concentrated liquidity mechanism
- Handles token swaps and price calculations
- Manages liquidity positions
- Implements price oracle functionality
- Key components:
  - Position management
  - Tick system for price ranges
  - Fee calculation and collection
  - Flash loan functionality
  - Protocol fee management

### Key Features
1. Concentrated Liquidity
   - Custom price ranges for LP positions
   - Tick-based price tracking
   - Efficient capital usage

2. Multiple Fee Tiers
   - Configurable fee levels (0.05%, 0.3%, 1%)
   - Different pools for same token pair

3. Price Oracle
   - Time-weighted average price (TWAP)
   - Observation array for historical data
   - Oracle cardinality management

## 2. Peripheral Contracts

### SwapRouter
- Handles routing between pools
